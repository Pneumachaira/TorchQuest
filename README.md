# TorchQuest
A text-based game created on a smartphone

TorchQuest was my first big foray into programming, using C4Droid on my smartphone.
Though I'm uploading this in 2022, this was made way back in 2016.
The game features various different aspects of conditionals and variables that I had just learned.
